organism.description:	Medicago truncatula, a close relative of alfalfa (M. sativa), is widely used as a model in legume biology. It is physically small in stature, with a small genome, and has a short generation-to-generation time. Sevweral high-quality genome assemblies have been generated, including Tang et al., 2014 (DOI:10.1186/1471-2164-15-312) and Pecrix et al., 2018 (DOI:10.1038/s41477-018-0286-7).
